# Loan Payoff Calculator

This application is a Tkinter-based GUI tool for calculating loan payoff schedules, visualizing payment breakdowns over time, and exporting schedules to a CSV file. The calculator allows users to enter loan details such as the current balance, annual interest rate, monthly payments, and the date (month and year) when payments begin. It displays the loan payoff duration (in months and years) and the cumulative accrued interest over the entire loan period.

## Features
